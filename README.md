# Library Management System üìñüìöüî•

Welcome to the **Library Management System** ‚Äì a comprehensive backend application built using **Spring Boot**, designed to efficiently manage library operations in a college environment.

This system allows students to register, issue books, return them, and track their transactions. It also enforces core library rules such as:

- Maximum book issuance limits
- Late return fines
- Card activation/deactivation status

The project follows a clean **Monolithic Architecture**, with a well-structured layering of:

- **Controller** ‚Äì Handles API endpoints
- **Service** ‚Äì Contains business logic
- **Repository** ‚Äì Interacts with the database
- **Model** ‚Äì Represents the data/entities

Built with performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind, this application provides a solid foundation for managing student-library interactions.

## Backend Design: Entities üìÑ 

### Entity Overview

| Entity      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Student** | Represents library users. Contains fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, and is associated with a `Card`. |
| **Card**    | Linked to a student. Tracks `status` (ACTIVATED/DEACTIVATED), `createdOn`, `updatedOn`, and maintains references to issued `Books` and `Transactions`. |
| **Book**    | Represents a library book. Contains fields such as `id`, `title`, `genre`, `author`, and an `isAvailable` flag to indicate availability. |
| **Author**  | Represents book authors. Contains fields like `name`, `email`, and `country`. Each `Book` is linked to one `Author`. |
| **Transaction** | Records every book issue or return operation. Tracks `transactionId` (UUID), `date`, `card`, `book`, `fineAmount`, `isIssueOperation` (true for issue, false for return), and `transactionStatus` (e.g. SUCCESSFUL). |

| `PUT`  | `/updateStudent` | Update an existing student's information. |
| `DELETE` | `/deleteStudent?id={id}` | Delete a student by ID. |
| `GET`  | `/getAll` | Retrieve a list of all students. |
| `GET`  | `/getStudent/{id}` | Retrieve a student by their ID. |

---

### Book Controller (`/Books`) üìö 

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/addBook` | Add a new book to the library. |
| `GET`  | `/getBooks?genre=&available=&author=` | Retrieve books with optional filters: `genre`, `available` (true/false), and `author`. |

| `DELETE` | `/deleteBook/{id}` | Delete a book by its ID. |
| `GET`  | `/getBook/{id}` | Get detailed information of a book by ID. |

---

### Author Controller (`/authors`) ‚úçÔ∏è 

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/add` | Add a new author. |
| `PUT`  | `/update` | Update an author's details. |

### Transaction Controller (`/transactions`) üîÑ 

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/issue?cardId={cardId}&bookId={bookId}` | Issue a book to a student using their card ID. Returns a unique Transaction ID. |
| `POST` | `/return?cardId={cardId}&bookId={bookId}` | Return a previously issued book. Calculates fine if applicable and returns Transaction ID. |


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  

For issuing or returning a book, system will validate:
- Whether the card is activated.
- Whether the book is available (for issue).
- Book already linked with card (for return).
- Number of books issued under a card (should not exceed limit).
- Fine amount based on predefined configuration.
